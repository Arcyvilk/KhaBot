# Functionalities
## Managing streamers 
Whenever someone starts streaming, bot assigns a Live Stream role to them. For it to work like it's supposed to be, you need to:
* create a role which you want to automatically assign to people who start live stream
* check the "Display this role separately from online members" option
* put KhaBot *above* this role - this gives him permissions to assign this role to streamers
## Default commands
* ``kha!help`` - shows  the full list of commands that KhaBot has
* ``kha!add <keyword>|<content>|<(optional)description>`` - adds your own commands - although only simple ones, where bot reacts with a text reply to a keyword
* ``kha!remove <keyword>`` - removes custom command (can't remove default ones)
* ``kha!streamrolename <stream_role_name>`` - changes the role supposed to showcase the live streamers (case sensitive)
## Reactions
Bot uses reactions to let you know if he could execute the command:
* ‚úÖ - command succesfully executed
* ‚ö†Ô∏è - something went wrong
* üö´ - user doesn't have permissions to perform this command
